## Features
- **Automated Lung Segmentation:** Achieves high accuracy with minimal computation time.
- **Deep Learning Architecture:** Utilizes a 3-layer U-Net with skip connections and pretrained encoder weights.
- **Dataset Agnostic:** Trained and tested on diverse datasets, ensuring robustness.
- **Real-Time Segmentation:** Processes each 2D slice in under 50 milliseconds using a GPU.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shashi1119/Lung_Segmentation.git
   cd Lung_Segmentation
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**
   Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

## Dataset

This project utilizes lung segmentation datasets such as the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset. The dataset consists of 1000 CT scans with manually annotated lung masks.

### Preparing the Dataset
1. Download and extract the dataset.
2. Organize the images and masks in the following structure:
   ```plaintext
   dataset/
   |-- images/
   |   |-- image1.png
   |   |-- image2.png
   |   |-- ...
   |-- masks/
   |   |-- mask1.png
   |   |-- mask2.png
   |   |-- ...
   ```
3. Update the dataset path in the configuration file or script.

### Preprocessing Steps
- Clip voxel intensities between -125 HU to 275 HU for normalization.
- Resample volumes to 1mm x 1mm x 1mm resolution if required.
- Extract central axial slices of size 256x256 pixels for training and testing.

## Usage

### Training the Model
1. Prepare the dataset as described above.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

### Evaluating the Model
1. Use the evaluation script to test the model on validation or test data:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

### Testing with New Images
1. Provide the path to a test image:
   ```bash
   python test.py --image_path path/to/image.png
   ```
2. The script will output the segmented lung region.

## Model Architecture

The model employs a U-Net architecture with the following features:
- **Encoder:** Extracts hierarchical visual features using pretrained convolutional layers.
- **Decoder:** Reconstructs segmentation masks using transposed convolutions.
- **Skip Connections:** Transfers low-level spatial information between encoder and decoder layers.
- **Optimization:** Uses binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Dice Similarity Coefficient:** Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth masks (average Dice score: 0.938).
- **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Evaluates spatial agreement (average IoU score: 0.859).
- **Runtime Performance:** Processes 2D slices in under 50 milliseconds on GPU.
